context: |
  In order to provide a consistent user interface while making underlying changes,
  we are replacing the `commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy` command with a more concise
  `commcare-cloud <env> deploy` command.

details: |
  Previously, to update to the latest version of CommCare, we recommended using commcare-cloud's
  `fab deploy` command. As part of an effort to present a consistent user interface in the future
  and to keep all of deploy's options and features well documented in CLI help text and
  online command docs, we will be switching to a top-level more simply-named `deploy` command.
  It currently executes the same code as `fab deploy` did before it, but as we add or rewrite
  functionality in the future, we are no longer tied to using fab as the underlying tool.
  We hope this will help us continue to improve our tooling in the future with minimal effect
  on your normal routine.

update_steps: |
  The only change you need to make is where you were previously using
  `commcare-cloud <env> fab deploy` to update your servers to the latest version of CommCare,
  you should now use `commcare-cloud <env> deploy`.

  See `commcare-cloud <env> deploy -h` for the full list of options on this new command.
