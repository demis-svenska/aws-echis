  This change extracts a new role from the existing postgresql role for installing
  and configuring pgbouncer.

  As a result of this change the `postgresql.yml` environment configuration file
  needs to be changed to split out the postgresql vars from the pgbouncer vars.

details: |
  Previously there was a field in `<env>/postgresql.yml` called `override` which allowed
  overriding vars from the postgresql role. This var has now been split in two to represent
  the two distinct roles for postgresql and pgbouncer.

  The vars should be split accordingly.

update_steps: |
  Edit the `postgresql.yml` file in all environments to split the `override` var as follows:

  ```diff
  - override:
  + pgbouncer_override:
      pgbouncer_pool_mode: transaction
      pgbouncer_*
  +
  + postgres_override:
      postgresql_version: "9.6"
      postgresql_*
  ```
